# Introduction

In the current IT landscape of the Dutch government, data is distributed across many organizations. To increase interoperability between datasets, much effort has already been put into standardization on different levels ([data modelling](https://docs.geostandaarden.nl/mim/mim/), [API strategy/guidelines](https://docs.geostandaarden.nl/api/API-Strategie/), [OGC standards](https://www.ogc.org/standards/), etc.). Despite these efforts, challenges arise when data integrators want to combine data from different sources:

- There is no formal specification of how individual datasets relate to each other.
- Different needs require different data combinations. There is no single model covering every use case.
- It can be a burden to technically combine data in a correct and efficient manner.
- When having a combined product, it is not transparant how the data was composed.

The end goal of this initiatiave is to fill in the gaps to eventually eliminate the challenges above.
